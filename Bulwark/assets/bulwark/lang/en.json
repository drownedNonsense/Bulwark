These areas restrict the placement of any blocks except siege equipment in a 64x64x64 area for <a href=\"handbook://block-bulwark:flagpole-fort\">forts</a> and in a 96x96x96 area for <a href=\"handbook://block-bulwark:flagpole-city\">cities</a> (by default). Members receive alerts about attacks, captures, or losses. A high quantity of food is required to keep strongholds active, with up to 4 containers allowed around the flag and equally around each logistic posts. The player who captures the flag gains ownership of the stronghold.<br><br><strong>Logistic Posts</strong><br>Logistic posts allow the binding of multiple food storages to a single flag, including cellars. They must have the same banner as the flag; capturing them stops the supply to the stronghold.<br><br><strong>Barricades</strong><br>Barricades can be set up in enemy strongholds. They need to be broken multiple times before disappearing and are unstable, not allowing for stacking.<br>"
